# Matrix Operations Program

This Python program provides functionality to create, manipulate, and perform various operations on matrices. The program uses the **NumPy** library for matrix operations, and allows the user to:

- Create matrices of specified dimensions
- Fill matrices with user input
- Perform matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- Transpose matrices

## Features

- **Matrix Creation**: Allows the user to create matrices with custom dimensions (rows and columns).
- **Matrix Filling**: The user can manually input values for each element in the matrix.
- **Matrix Operations**: Supports matrix addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), and multiplication (`*`) between two matrices.
- **Matrix Transposition**: Allows transposing matrices using NumPy's built-in `transpose` function.
- **Formatted Output**: All matrices are printed in a formatted, easy-to-read layout with 3 decimal places of precision.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library

To install the required library, use the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy
